Nonlinear analysis of a fold

Are folded rocks a snapshot of a nonlinear dynamic system? The aim is to move a cursor through (x, y, z) coordinates for the surface of a deformed, folded rock and to watch data driven analyses change in different windows including: spatial attractors, wavelet transforms, singularity spectra, Hurst exponents, recurrence plots (including the ability for cross- and joint- recurrence plots and their quantitative analysis), Fourier transforms, recurrence histograms, networks, and sparsely determined nonlinear determinations of the differential equations describing the data. I have already used the Wolfram Language for some of these analyses, but I wish to use the Wolfram Language for all of these analyses, and interactively with the data and themselves so there may be feedback between the different forms of analysis providing an optimal nonlinear description of the data. Putting all this together I think is new, but the most important aspect is providing an easy to use tool from the nonlinear dynamical toolbox for geologists to explore their data, 1D, 2D, 3D, in a completely new way. The use of the tool requires a pedagogic approach to its development.
